## Task 4: Insights and Recommendations

### Methodology
- **Objective**: Derive insights from sentiment and themes, visualize results, and recommend app improvements.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified drivers (e.g., UI for CBE, transactions for Dashen) and pain points (e.g., performance for BOA) using keyword analysis.
  - Compared banks based on sentiment and themes.
  - Suggested improvements (e.g., budgeting tool, performance optimization).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Sentiment trend by rating (bar plot).
  - Rating distribution per bank (count plot).
  - Word cloud of keywords per bank.
- **Ethics**: Noted potential biases (e.g., negative skew) and privacy concerns.
- **Output**: Saved as `scraper/visualize_task4.ipynb`.
